        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Ariana Dasso, a freelance web developer with a passion 
          for bringing small businesses and independent contractors’ visions 
          to life online. I work directly with individuals to create functional 
          yet beautiful websites that help reach more customers. With both a Bachelor's 
          and Master's degree in Computer Science, I’ve honed my skills in designing and 
          developing websites that not only look great but also perform exceptionally well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in crafting custom websites tailored to the unique needs of my clients, focusing 
          on both functionality and aesthetics. From plumbers to custom candle boutique owners, 
          I’m dedicated to creating a digital presence that reflects your brand and helps you 
          achieve your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you can find me in the kitchen experimenting 
          with new recipes or enjoying quality time with my husband and our dogs on our ranch. 
          Balancing my professional and personal life is important to me, and I believe it’s this 
          balance that fuels my creativity and drive in both my work and personal projects.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Let’s connect and make your web presence shine!
